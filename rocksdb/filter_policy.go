// bits_per_key is 10, which yields a filter with ~1% false positive rate.

// Note: if you are using a custom comparator that ignores some parts
// of the keys being compared, you must not use NewBloomFilterPolicy()
// and must provide your own FilterPolicy that also ignores the
// corresponding parts of the keys.  For example, if the comparator
// ignores trailing spaces, it would be incorrect to use a
// FilterPolicy (like NewBloomFilterPolicy) that does not ignore
// trailing spaces in keys.
