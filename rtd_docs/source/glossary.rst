Q.E.D Event
-----------

We define ``Q.E.D.`` event as the result of applying a SHA256 hash function to a piece of data generated for its inclusion in QED.
Each event has a temporal relation between the next and the prior one.

QED represents the temporal relation by an always increasing 64-bit integer called QED version.
