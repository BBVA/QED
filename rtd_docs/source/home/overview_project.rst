Overview
========

``Q.E.D.`` is a software to test the scalability of authenticated data structures. Our mission is to design a system which, even when deployed into a non-trusted server, allows one to verify the integrity of a chain of events and detect modifications of single events or parts of its history.

This software is experimental and part of the research being done at BBVA Labs. We will eventually publish our research work, analysis and the experiments for anyone to reproduce.
