Quick start
===========

This section will guide you through QED functionality.

Mainly, you can **add events** to QED, ask for the proof that an event
**has been inserted**, ask for the proof that two events are **consistent**
between each other, and verify (manual or automatically) each of both proofs.

For each step we will use the **QED CLI** facility.
The client will talk to the QED server and the snapshot store, so it must be
configured for that proposal.

The involved variables are the following ones, and we will use pre-defined
values for this quickstart.

.. code-block:: shell

      --api-key             string  Set API Key to talk to QED Log service (default "my-key")
      --endpoints           string  REST QED Log service endpoint list http://ip1:port1,http://ip2:port2...  (default [http://127.0.0.1:8800])
      --snapshot-store-url  string  REST Snapshot store service endpoint http://ip:port  (default "http://127.0.0.1:8888")


1. Environment set up
---------------------

Pre-requisites:

- **docker** (see https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/)

- **docker-compose** (see https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Once you have these pre-requisites installed, setting up the quickstart
environment is as easy as:

.. code::

    $ git clone https://github.com/BBVA/qed.git
    $ cd deploy/docker
    $ docker-compose up -d

This simple environment comprises 3 services: **QED Log server**,
**QED Publisher agent**, and **Snapshot store**. You should be able
to check them by typing:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ docker ps

Listing there these 3 services.

.. important::

    To use the QED client using docker (and forget about installing golang -among other stuff-), do the following:

    .. code::

        $ alias qed_client='docker run -it --net=docker_default bbvalabs/qed:v0.2.3-docs qed client --endpoints http://qed_server_0:8800 --snapshot-store-url http://snapshotstore:8888'

Once finished the Quickstart section, don't forget to clean the environment:

.. code::

    $ docker-compose down
    $ unalias qed


2. Adding events.
-----------------

In this step the client only interact with the QED server (no snapshot store
info is required). The mandatory field here is the event to insert.

So, let's insert 4 simple events:

.. code::

    $ qed_client add --event "event 0"

    Received snapshot with values:

        EventDigest: 5beeaf427ee0bfcd1a7b6f63010f2745110cf23ae088b859275cd0aad369561b
        HyperDigest: 6a050f12acfc22989a7681f901a68ace8a9a3672428f8a877f4d21568123a0cb
        HistoryDigest: b8fdd4b2146fe560f94d7a48f8bb3eaf6938f7de6ac6d05bbe033787d8b71846
        Version: 0

    $ qed_client add --event "event 1"
    ...
    $ qed_client add --event "event 2"
    ...
    $ qed_client add --event "event 3"

    Received snapshot with values:

        EventDigest: 6c5cd6775eb412207f7f71f11f09047f1475b2b7526063195b777a230fe4c2a6
        HyperDigest: 7bd6cee5eb0b92801ed4ce58c54a76907221bb4e056165679977b16487e5f015
        HistoryDigest: 4f95cd9fd828abe86b092e506bbffd4662d9431c5755d68eed1ba5e5156fdb13
        Version: 3

This operation should return only if it has been completed successfully or not.
But currently, it returns certain info for debugging/testing purposes.
In fact, we will retrieve this information later from the right place.

.. note::

    Take a look at the add help section by typing:

    .. code::

        $ qed_client add -h


3. Proof of event insertion.
----------------------------

3.1 Querying proof.
+++++++++++++++++++

To get this proof we only need the original event.
Therefore... has "event 0" been inserted?

    .. code::

        $ qed_client membership --event "event 0"

        Querying event [ event 0 ] with latest version

        Received membership proof:

            Exists: true
            Hyper audit path: <TRUNCATED>
            History audit path: <TRUNCATED>
            CurrentVersion: 3
            QueryVersion: 3
            ActualVersion: 0
            KeyDigest: 5beeaf427ee0bfcd1a7b6f63010f2745110cf23ae088b859275cd0aad369561b

Yes! It was inserted in version 0 (ActualVersion), the last event inserted
has version 3 (CurrentVersion), and there is a proof for you to check it.

.. note::

    We print proofs as <TRUNCATED> due to these crypthographical proofs are too long and difficult to read.

3.2 Getting snapshots from the snapshot store.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This proof shows the version in which the event was inserted.
So, let's ask for the snapshot with that version
(it contains the information needed -"HyperDigest" and "HistoryDigest"- to verify proofs).

    .. code::

        $ qed_client get --version 3

        Retreived snapshot with values:

            EventDigest: 6c5cd6775eb412207f7f71f11f09047f1475b2b7526063195b777a230fe4c2a6
            HyperDigest: 7bd6cee5eb0b92801ed4ce58c54a76907221bb4e056165679977b16487e5f015
            HistoryDigest: 4f95cd9fd828abe86b092e506bbffd4662d9431c5755d68eed1ba5e5156fdb13
            Version: 3

.. note::

    The snapshot store is the right place to look for digests, instead of using the result of the adding step.

    Take a look at the get help section by typing:

    $ qed_client get -h


3.3 Verifying proof (manually).
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Having the proof and the necessary information, let's verify the former.
The interactive process will ask you the info previously retrieved.

    .. code::

        $ qed_client membership --event "event 0" --verify

        Querying event [ event 0 ] with latest version

        Received membership proof:

            Exists: true
            Hyper audit path: <TRUNCATED>
            History audit path: <TRUNCATED>
            CurrentVersion: 3
            QueryVersion: 3
            ActualVersion: 0
            KeyDigest: 5beeaf427ee0bfcd1a7b6f63010f2745110cf23ae088b859275cd0aad369561b

        Please, provide the hyperDigest for current version [ 3 ]: 28b2a8d7bfeedc61b988e5bddaf260f21aee96bfe88392a0af8a06d7129ab86d
        Please, provide the historyDigest for version [ 3 ] : b8fdd4b2146fe560f94d7a48f8bb3eaf6938f7de6ac6d05bbe033787d8b71846

        Verifying event with:

            EventDigest: 5beeaf427ee0bfcd1a7b6f63010f2745110cf23ae088b859275cd0aad369561b
            HyperDigest: 28b2a8d7bfeedc61b988e5bddaf260f21aee96bfe88392a0af8a06d7129ab86d
            HistoryDigest: b8fdd4b2146fe560f94d7a48f8bb3eaf6938f7de6ac6d05bbe033787d8b71846
            Version: 3

        Verify: OK

And yes! We can verify the membership of "event 0".

3.4 Auto-verifying proofs.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This process is similar to the previous one, but we get the snapshots from the
snapshot store in a transparent way.

    .. code::

        $ qed_client membership --event "event 0" --auto-verify

        Querying key [ 0 ] with latest version

        Received membership proof:

            Exists: true
            Hyper audit path: <TRUNCATED>
            History audit path: <TRUNCATED>
            CurrentVersion: 3
            QueryVersion: 3
            ActualVersion: 0
            KeyDigest: 5beeaf427ee0bfcd1a7b6f63010f2745110cf23ae088b859275cd0aad369561b


        Auto-Verifying event with:

            EventDigest: 5beeaf427ee0bfcd1a7b6f63010f2745110cf23ae088b859275cd0aad369561b
            Version: 3

        Verify: OK


4. Incremental proof between 2 events.
--------------------------------------

4.1 Querying proof.
+++++++++++++++++++

For this proof we don't need the events, but the QED version in which they
were added (you can get both versions by doing membership proofs as above).

    .. code::

        $ qed_client incremental --start 0 --end 3

        Querying incremental between versions [ 0 ] and [ 3 ]

        Received incremental proof:

            Start version: 0
            End version: 3
            Incremental audit path: <TRUNCATED>

4.2 Getting snapshots from the snapshot store.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This process is similar to the one explained in section 2.2.
As we need 2 snapshots, we repeat the query for each version.

    .. code::

        $ qed_client get --version 0

        Retreived snapshot with values:

            EventDigest: 5beeaf427ee0bfcd1a7b6f63010f2745110cf23ae088b859275cd0aad369561b
            HyperDigest: 6a050f12acfc22989a7681f901a68ace8a9a3672428f8a877f4d21568123a0cb
            HistoryDigest: b8fdd4b2146fe560f94d7a48f8bb3eaf6938f7de6ac6d05bbe033787d8b71846
            Version: 0

        $ qed_client get --version 3

        Retreived snapshot with values:

            EventDigest: 6c5cd6775eb412207f7f71f11f09047f1475b2b7526063195b777a230fe4c2a6

            Version: 3

4.3 Verifying proofs (manually).
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To verify the proof manually, the process will ask you to enter the required
digests.

        .. code::

            $ qed_client incremental --start 0 --end 3 --verify

            Querying incremental between versions [ 0 ] and [ 3 ]

            Received incremental proof:

                Start version: 0
                End version: 3
                Incremental audit path: <TRUNCATED>

            Please, provide the starting historyDigest for version [ 0 ]: b8fdd4b2146fe560f94d7a48f8bb3eaf6938f7de6ac6d05bbe033787d8b71846
            Please, provide the ending historyDigest for version [ 3 ] : 4f95cd9fd828abe86b092e506bbffd4662d9431c5755d68eed1ba5e5156fdb13

            Verifying with snapshots:
                HistoryDigest for start version [ 0 ]: b8fdd4b2146fe560f94d7a48f8bb3eaf6938f7de6ac6d05bbe033787d8b71846
                HistoryDigest for end version [ 3 ]: 4f95cd9fd828abe86b092e506bbffd4662d9431c5755d68eed1ba5e5156fdb13

            Verify: OK

4.4 Auto-verifying proofs.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This process is similar to the previous one, but we get the snapshots from the
snapshot store in a transparent way.

        .. code::

            $ qed_client incremental --start 0 --end 3 --auto-verify

            Querying incremental between versions [ 0 ] and [ 3 ]

            Received incremental proof:

                Start version: 0
                End version: 3
                Incremental audit path: <TRUNCATED>


            Auto-Verifying event with:

                Start: 0
                End: 3

            Verify: OK
