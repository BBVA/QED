How can we create transparency about a transaction that somebody as interest to
certify that a ``DOCUMENT`` is emited that way?

Allowing QED to store a fingerprint of the transaction ``F(DOCUMENT)``, will
prove that it was as intented.

Furthermore the proof returned by the QED server it is a criptographic proof
``WARRANT`` with legal validity.

QED is a **tamper evident** storage, that is that QED it can be deployed in
untrusted servers, because of the way QED stores the transactions.
